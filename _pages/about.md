I'm currently pursuing my <b>Master of Science</b> in <b>Computer Science</b> from <b>George Mason University</b>. Before starting my Master's I was working as a <b>Senior Software Engineer</b>. During this time, I worked closely with Data Science and Analytics teams. The power of AI/ML in production kept increasing my interest to the point where I decided to pursue this in-depth in my Master's.

Currently, I am doing my research on <b>Socially Acceptable Behaviour</b> for <b>Autonomous Agents</b>. Apart from the broad field of Machine Learning, I'm interested in <b>Computer Vision</b>, <b>Motion Planning</b> and <b>Multimodal Learning</b>.

I am <b>curretly seeking Internship Opportunities</b> for <b>Summer 2023</b>. I would like to work on challenging projects in a progressive organization which will provide me a scope to apply and grow my skills.
