Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a <b>Google Certified TensorFlow Developer</b>, former <b>Senior Software Engineer</b>,  and currently a <b>Graduate Student</b> in MS CS program at George Mason University. I have strong academic and industry experience in developing and implementing AI/ML solutions.


I have experience in building Retrieval <b>Augmented Generation [RAG]</b> application by combining Generative AI, LLM, and External Knowledge Source. I worked with <a href='https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/'> <b>Prof. Xuesu Xiao</b></a> in GMU's <b>AI and Robotics Lab</b> to create a <b>Deep Neural Network</b> with using <b>Multimodal Perception</b> for enhancing social navigation skills of  mobile robots.

I am actively seeking <b>full-time opportunities</b> in the field of <b>Machine Learning</b> starting Summer 2024. I am eager to apply and grow my skills by working on challenging projects within a progressive organization.





<!-- I've worked under the supervision of   in the <b>AI and Robotics Lab</b> at GMU. My current research is centered around learning<b> Socially Acceptable Navigation</b> for <b>Mobile Robots</b> by leveraging <b>Multimodal Deep Neural Networks</b>. In addition to the broad field of Machine Learning, I have a keen interest in Generative AI, Computer Vision, and Multimodal Learning.
