Welcome to my personal website! I am a Master of Science in Computer Science student at George Mason University. As a <b>Google Certified TensorFlow Developer</b> and former <b>Senior Software Engineer</b>, I have a strong background in developing and implementing AI/ML solutions.

My current research focuses on <b>Socially Acceptable Navigation for Mobile Robots</b>. In addition to the broad field of Machine Learning, I have a keen interest in Computer Vision, Motion Planning, and Multimodal Learning.

I am actively seeking <b>Full-time</b> opportunities as a <b>Machine Learning Engineer</b> starting Summer 2024. I am eager to apply and grow my skills by working on challenging projects within a progressive organization.
