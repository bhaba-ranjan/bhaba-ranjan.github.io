Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a <b>Software Development Engineer-II</b> at <b>Amazon</b>. Prior to joining Amazon, I graduated from the MS in Computer Science program at George Mason University. I have strong academic and industry experience in developing and implementing AI/ML solutions.


I have experience in building <b>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</b> applications by combining Generative AI, LLMs, and external knowledge sources. I worked under the supervision of <a href='https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/'> <b>Prof. Xuesu Xiao</b></a> in GMUâ€™s AI and Robotics Lab, where I created a deep neural network using multimodal perception to enhance the social navigation skills of mobile robots.

When not immersed in code, I'm preparing for hiking and other outdoor activities. I enjoy reading non-fiction and exploring deep tech articles. I'm also working on improving my novice guitar skills. Occasionally, I unwind with a good TV series.





<!-- I've worked under the supervision of   in the <b>AI and Robotics Lab</b> at GMU. My current research is centered around learning<b> Socially Acceptable Navigation</b> for <b>Mobile Robots</b> by leveraging <b>Multimodal Deep Neural Networks</b>. In addition to the broad field of Machine Learning, I have a keen interest in Generative AI, Computer Vision, and Multimodal Learning.

I am actively seeking <b>full-time opportunities</b> in the field of <b>Machine Learning</b> starting Summer 2024. I am eager to apply and grow my skills by working on challenging projects within a progressive organization. -->
